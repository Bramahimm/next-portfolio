## ü™ê Portfolio ‚Äî Built with Next.js

This is my personal portfolio built using **Next.js App Router**, featuring a unique visual identity and a hidden interactive game.

At the bottom of the page, you'll find a mysterious brick labeled **Bramahimsa**. You can move the ball using `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys and press `Space` to jump. It's a playful touch that reflects my creative philosophy.
